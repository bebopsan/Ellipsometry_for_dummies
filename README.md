========================

This repository contains a python application for the visualization of polarization states. 

This repository also contains a quick documentation in the form of a poster named "polarization_poster.pdf". 
To visualize it  go to "View code" then click on polarization_poster.pdf and select "Open binary file".

To run the application you must have Python 3 installed as well as some mayor packages such as:
* PyQt4
* Scipy

Once you have a working version of python go to a terminal an execute:
